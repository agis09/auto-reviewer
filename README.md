**Concept:**

Automate code reviews using Gemini's code analysis capabilities, triggered by GitHub events.

**Core Components:**

* **GitHub Integration:**
    * **Webhooks:** Configure GitHub webhooks to trigger events when code is pushed to specific repositories.
    * **GitHub API:**  Use the GitHub API to retrieve code changes from the pushed commits.
* **Gemini API:**
    * **Gemini Client:**  A client library to interact with the Gemini API for code analysis. 
* **Code Processing & Review Engine:**
    * **Code Parsing:** Parse the code changes retrieved from GitHub into a format suitable for Gemini analysis.
    * **Gemini Analysis:**  Send the parsed code to Gemini for analysis (e.g., static analysis, security checks, code style).
    * **Review Report Generation:**  Process the results of Gemini's analysis and generate a human-readable code review report.
* **GitHub Reporting:**
    * **GitHub Comments/Pull Request Feedback:** Post the generated code review report as comments on the GitHub pull request or commit.


**Workflow:**

1. **Code Push:** Developer pushes code to the GitHub repository.
2. **GitHub Webhook:**  GitHub triggers a webhook event to the auto code review system.
3. **GitHub Service:** Receives the webhook event, extracts relevant data (repository, commit, changes), and fetches code from GitHub.
4. **Code Processing Service:** Parses the code changes and prepares them for Gemini analysis.
5. **Gemini Service:**  Sends the code to Gemini for analysis.
6. **Code Processing Service:**  Receives Gemini's analysis results.
7. **Reporting Service:**  Generates a code review report (e.g., in Markdown, JSON).
8. **GitHub Service:** Posts the review report as comments on the relevant GitHub pull request or commit.
